    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>185 g canned tuna</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>30 g green onions</li>
            <li>45 g onion</li>
            <li>20 g red bell peppers</li>
            <li>20 g green bell peppers</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tsp all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>A few sprinkles ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Some cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dipping sauce by whisking all the dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine all the prepared main ingredients (excluding the oil) in a mixing bowl and mix them well.</li>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium low heat and once heated add some cooking oil across the pan. Scoop out the tuna mixture with a spoon (heaped), and gently place it onto the pan (each spoonful mixture makes one pancake). Cook for 2-3 mins. Flip them over and cook another 2-3 mins, or until golden brown.
                You can also tell it is ready when no egg liquid seeps out when you gently press the mixture down with a spatula.
                Remove from the pan when both sides of the pancake are cooked. Repeat this until all the remaining mixture is used up. You may need to add more cooking oil between the batches.</li>
            <li>Serve with the dipping sauce. Also with cooked rice and other Korean side dishes.</li>
        </ol>
